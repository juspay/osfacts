# osfacts

osfacts answers one question: what does the OS say about these processes and
their sockets. You'd think that question was answered decades ago. It wasn't.
Every tool we tried answers a slightly different question, and we measured our
way through seven of them before concluding we had to write this one.

```sh
osfacts snapshot --roots 4242 --procs --ports     # this subtree: procs + listening ports
osfacts snapshot --pids 991 --mem --start-time --cpu-time # exact pids: RSS + start + cumulative CPU µs
osfacts snapshot --uid --cwd --status --argv      # every pid: identity + launch details
osfacts host --load --mem --cpu --net --disk      # machine gauges, metadata + cumulative counters
osfacts snapshot --procs --json | jq              # same facts, readable
```

One verb, composable facets. On a Linux host with about 450 processes, the
one-process `--procs --ports` shape takes 6.5 ms; every process facet host-wide
takes 24.3 ms. The flags matter. We know because we time the shapes users run,
not a toy command that happens to make the number look good.

## Scoping

The whole trick is `--roots`: ask about one process subtree and that subtree
is what you pay for. Every tool we measured scans the whole machine and then
filters — one of them took 26.0 ms host-wide and 25.1 ms "scoped", which
isn't scoping, it's grep. Cost should track the ask, not the host. A terminal
with three processes shouldn't cost you eight hundred.

And the snapshot carries the full pid→ppid table, so a grandchild listener
walks back to its root. A dev server is usually `shell → npm → node`; if your
tool only shows you the `node`, you know a port is open but not whose it is.
That's the question that matters, and it's the one the listener-only tools
can't answer.

## Performance

One timing for a composable command is usually a lie. `--ports` walks file
descriptors; `--argv` reads command lines; `--roots` can turn 450 processes
into one. So these are the useful numbers: 31 interleaved warm runs on
`naiveintent`, with 450–466 live Linux processes and stdout captured as a real
client captures it.

| shape | before the Linux pass | current |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| host-wide `--procs` | 10.93 ms | 9.43 ms |
| host-wide `--procs --ports` | 27.59 ms | 17.80 ms |
| host-wide, every process facet | 52.56 ms | 24.33 ms |
| `host --load --mem --cpu --net --disk` | 2.61 ms | 2.61 ms |
| drishti's two calls, serial | 55.41 ms | 26.48 ms |
| one-process `--roots`, `--procs --ports` | 7.58 ms | 6.49 ms |
| 83-process subtree, `--procs --ports` | 19.85 ms | 17.27 ms |

The large win came from mundane waste: the same `stat` file was opened four
times per pid, output was written a row at a time, and a host-wide fd walk ran
in one long line. The Linux reader now opens shared proc files once, reads
virtual files into a page-sized buffer, reuses `stat`'s RSS field in combined
snapshots, buffers stdout, and splits only large fd walks into ordered workers.
Small scopes stay on the simple path.

The live lane also samples the child CPU consumed by 11 interleaved warm
`--procs` and all-facet snapshots, and budgets the difference. Child CPU against
a same-load baseline is what makes this a smoke rather than a wall-clock
benchmark: another job can delay osfacts or disturb its caches without
manufacturing a regression.

The budget has two terms, because the cost has two drivers. `--ports` walks
every process's file descriptors, so it scales with descriptor count; the other
seven facets read a file or two per process, so they scale with process count.
The budget is 75 µs per process plus 20 µs per readable descriptor. On an idle
407-process, 2725-descriptor host the measured costs are about 15 µs per process
and 6.0 µs per descriptor, so each term carries roughly 3x headroom — about what
a contended CI box needs.

A single process-scaled budget was the first version, and it was wrong: on a
workstation the two counts track each other, but a CI container runs 50
processes while a build daemon holds thousands of descriptors, and there the fd
walk alone spends 20 ms against a 3.75 ms allowance. It failed on every CI host
it ran on while passing on the workstation it was calibrated against. Sizing a
per-process constant to cover that gap would have made the budget wider than the
regression it exists to catch.

## Honesty

When osfacts can't read a pid, it says so — with the errno, in an
`unreadable` section you can't turn off. Blindness is output, not absence.
The listener table is independent of attribution: a socket whose owning fd
cannot be read still appears as `unclaimed` (with its uid on linux). Under a
narrow scope that word matters — the owner may simply be outside the ask.

Why so strict? Because we shipped the other thing. A reader that silently
dropped unreadable pids once emptied a whole panel of facts the moment
someone ran `sudo` — one password prompt, and every terminal on the host
reported "nothing here", successfully. "We couldn't look" and "there is
nothing" are different answers. A tool that conflates them will eventually
lie to you at the worst moment, and you won't know.

The rest of the contract follows the same instinct. The schema version is the
first thing on stdout, so a consumer built against another revision fails
loudly instead of parsing half a shape into zero rows. Addresses come as raw
bytes, never a cooked "wildcard" flag — you keep exactly one classifier on
your side, because two predicates that must agree about `::ffff:0.0.0.0` is
how they come to disagree. And CPU time is cumulative per row, so CPU% is a
diff between two snapshots on your clock. A one-shot sampler should never
sleep; one tool we measured sleeps ~30 ms per call to compute a rate nobody
asked it for.

`--cpu-time` emits `C <pid> <cpu_time_us>`: user plus system CPU time since
process start, normalized to microseconds on both platforms. An unreadable pid
emits `U <pid> cpu_time <errno>` instead. The tool never computes CPU%; a
consumer differences two `cpu_time_us` values over its own wall-clock interval.

The other process details stay independent too. `--uid` emits the real uid
(name lookup belongs to the consumer); `--cwd` emits the current directory;
`--status` emits the one-character state, nice value, and a nullable thread
count; `--argv` emits the full argument vector, distinct from the short process
name. State and nice come from the public census, but on darwin the thread
count comes from the task port, which can be denied on its own — so a denied
thread read emits `U <pid> status_threads <errno>` beside the `STAT` row
instead of letting `null` stand in for "the kernel said none". Cwd and argv are JSON-encoded inside their final TSV field, so tabs,
newlines, and NULs cannot change row boundaries. Each failed read is its own
`U <pid> <facet> <errno>` row — asking for cwd cannot turn an unreadable cwd
into an empty path or erase a readable uid.

Host CPU rows carry a nonempty model plus nullable MHz. Apple Silicon does not
publish the frequency sysctl, so absence is `null` / `-`, never a fabricated
zero. Disk rows keep both meanings the kernel exposes: free bytes from `bfree`
and unprivileged-available bytes from `bavail`, alongside total bytes.

## Known limitations

Visibility is OS policy, not a parser trick. The same osfacts binary asks the
same questions on both systems. What changes is where the kernel draws the
line.

| OS | Visible for every process | Needs same uid or root | Listener consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | name, real uid, RSS, cumulative CPU time, and start time from `/proc` | cwd and fd targets, including port attribution | the kernel TCP table stays world-readable, so a socket survives as an unclaimed `L` row when its fd owner is hidden |
| Darwin | `kern.proc` gives pid, ppid, real uid, state, nice, start time, and short command; `proc_pidpath` gives the executable path | the full process view, including RSS, CPU time, cwd, argv, and fd attribution | same-uid fd walks still find claimed listeners; macOS 27+ hides the host-wide socket table from callers without Apple platform signing |

Linux's split is simple. Basic `/proc` process files are world-readable, but
the links under `/proc/<pid>/fd` and `/proc/<pid>/cwd` are not. The independent
`/proc/net/tcp{,6}` table is still readable, which is why failure to inspect an
owner produces an unclaimed listener instead of making the socket vanish.

Darwin lets an ordinary caller read every same-uid process. For another user's
process, the public census still supplies identity and start facts, but the task
APIs behind RSS and CPU time return `EPERM`. `ps` only looks like a
counterexample: on macOS it is setuid root, Apple-signed, and carries the private
`com.apple.system-task-ports.read` entitlement. Apple's own source calls
`task_read_for_pid` ([reader](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/adv_cmds/blob/main/ps/tasks.c),
[entitlement](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/adv_cmds/blob/main/ps/entitlements.plist)).
osfacts deliberately has none of those powers.

macOS 27 adds the same kind of gate to the host-wide TCP table. On zest,
Apple's platform-signed `/usr/sbin/sysctl` got 54,872 bytes from
`net.inet.tcp.pcblist_n`, and `/usr/sbin/netstat` saw 29 listeners. The
ad-hoc-signed osfacts binary got 48 bytes: only the opening and closing records.
The full capture decodes to all 29 rows, so the decoder is fine. The caller is
what changed. `netstat` carries `com.apple.private.network.statistics`; osfacts
does not.

The 48-byte shape is indistinguishable from a genuinely empty host-wide table,
so osfacts keeps reporting
`E darwin_tcp_pcblist ports_unclaimed BLIND_OR_EMPTY`. It does not throw away
facts it got elsewhere: the same-uid fd walk still emits its claimed listeners,
and the two sources are always merged as a union, so a table that omits a
listener the fd walk positively saw cannot delete it. What macOS 27 gates is
the independent table that would also reveal listeners no readable pid claimed.

A record the walker cannot frame is a different thing entirely. That is Apple
layout drift, and it fails loudly — `E darwin_tcp_pcblist ports EINVAL` —
rather than returning the rows read so far as a healthy, silently short table.
The 24-byte closing record every capture ends with is a terminator, not a
malformed record; both committed fixtures pin the difference.

Darwin also says out loud what it cannot read at all: neither of its listener
sources carries a socket's owning uid, so a `--ports` snapshot there always
emits `E darwin_listeners ports_uid ENOTSUP` and every `L` row's uid column is
`-`. Linux's `/proc/net/tcp` supplies it. Without that row a consumer would
have to know which OS it was running on to interpret a field of a
platform-independent contract.

Same binary, same honesty, different OS policy.

Source blindness is an `E <source> <facet> <code>` row, not an instruction to
discard facts that did arrive. A partial snapshot exits successfully and leaves
reject-versus-render policy to the consumer; an `E`-only result remains a total
failure and exits nonzero, as do usage and output failures. This distinction
keeps a blind port source from erasing valid process rows while making a
completely blind probe fail loudly.

The `facet` field is what makes that policy decidable without guessing from the
source name. It says which facet the silence actually costs, in the same
vocabulary the `U` rows use, so a consumer scopes source blindness exactly the
way it scopes per-pid blindness — ignoring what it never reads. The macOS 27
case is the one that matters: the host-wide table is the sole source of
listeners *nobody* claimed, so its silence is `ports_unclaimed`, not `ports`.
A consumer folding listeners per subtree loses no fact and must not go blind.
A hard failure of the only listener source — `/proc/net/tcp` on linux, or a
`net.inet.tcp.pcblist_n` sysctl that errors rather than returning the empty
shape — costs the whole facet and says `ports`.

One source can cost several facets, and then it says so once per facet.
Darwin's `kern.proc.all` is the sole supplier of process identity, start time,
uid, and state — so when it fails, a `--uid --status` ask gets
`E kern_proc_all uid <errno>` and `E kern_proc_all status <errno>`, not a bare
`proc` row a uid consumer would scope away before reading an empty table as
"this host has no processes with uids".

A host-global constant that fails is the mirror image: it costs the facet
once, as one `E` row, never one `U` row per process. Linux's `CLK_TCK` and
page size and darwin's mach timebase all report that way. Otherwise a
single failed `sysconf` would arrive as several hundred per-pid rows and a
successful exit.

The facet vocabulary itself has one home: the `Facet` enum in `src/schema.rs`.
No reader spells a facet as a string literal, and `facets.json` carries the
same list across to the TypeScript client, pinned from both sides by tests.

Host facets follow the same rule and are individually optional: a failed
uptime read emits `E <source> uptime <code>` and simply omits the `HUP` row,
rather than publishing a fabricated `0` a consumer would read as a legitimate
just-booted host.

`BLIND_OR_EMPTY` is the one code for a source that cannot tell *gated* from
*genuinely empty*, on both platforms. `lo`/`lo0` always exists, so an empty
interface table is a gated read on either OS, and both say so the same way —
a consumer that branches on the code must not have to know which kernel
produced the row.

## Who uses it

[kolu](https://github.com/juspay/kolu) — its terminal port sensor polls this
every few seconds, and its memory sampler, socket-takeover check, and daemon
supervisor all ask the same class of question — and
[drishti](https://github.com/srid/drishti) for process inspection. Anything
else gets the same facts from `--json`.

## Why not an existing tool

We measured, not surveyed. Each candidate fails on the contract, not on
packaging:

| tool | disqualifier |
| --- | --- |
| `osquery` | a resident fleet-telemetry agent with a SQL surface — ~378 ms/query, ~158 MB. Built for thousands of machines every few minutes, not one machine every five seconds |
| `procs` | discards the bind address, so loopback-only and wildcard collapse into one row |
| `portls` | no PPID, no process table — a listener can't be walked back to its root |
| `rustnet` | an interactive capture TUI; needs packet-capture privilege |
| `portview` | listener rows only, no process table, no scoping — its single-port query is a host-wide scan plus a filter |
| `sysinfo` + `listeners` | composing them enumerates the process list twice: 23 ms darwin / ~100 ms linux; osfacts' current Linux host-wide process+listener pass is 17.8 ms |
| `lsof` / `netstat` | `lsof` measured 93 ms; macOS `netstat` goes intermittently blind — success and zero rows in one window, 29 rows the next, same boot |

## Testing

Two lanes, split by which question they answer.

The first lane asks "did we break osfacts?" and gates every merge. It's
hermetic: `nix build` compiles the binary and then tests that same binary,
inside the sandbox, on both platforms. Both platforms use the same
strategy — bind port 0 in a parked child (`osfacts-listener`) and assert
osfacts sees *that* process and *that* socket under a scoped snapshot.
Assertions are self-referential ("my fixture appears exactly"), never
"the whole host table is empty", so a noisy dev box and a clean sandbox
exercise the same code path. There is no `unshare` / private-netns trick:
depending on a host kernel knob for user namespaces contradicted the
hermetic claim (and broke ubuntu-latest CI). The three fields no test can
pin — the real pid, owning uid, and kernel-chosen port — are redacted to stable
placeholders; everything else is byte-exact. The unreadable path is
tested against pid 1, which is always present and always forbidden.

The second lane asks "did the OS break osfacts?" It runs the nix-built binary
on a real, noisy host and diffs its answers against tools that don't share
its code: `ss` on linux, `lsof` and the upstream `listeners` crate on darwin.
This is the only kind of test that could have caught macOS 27's netstat going
intermittently blind while reporting success — inside a sandbox we control,
our fixtures and our reader would just keep agreeing with each other.

It is an explicit CI recipe (`ci::osfacts-live`), not a phase of `nix build`.
The build sandbox is there to shut the real world out: fixed inputs, no host
listeners, no kernel surprise. The live lane's whole job is the real world —
other users' ports, platform oracles, whatever the box happens to be running —
so folding it into the sandbox would delete the thing it is for.

And it gates, same as everything else. Both lanes are in branch protection:
a red — either lane — blocks the merge. We considered the industry's
convention here (live oracles as advisory, never blocking) and rejected it:
a red nobody has to obey is a red everybody learns to skip. When the live
lane goes red without anyone having broken osfacts, that usually means the
OS drifted under the tool — which is exactly when merging should stop, not
continue. The costs are accepted with eyes open: host noise can block an
unrelated merge until a rerun clears it, and the darwin live box is now on
the merge-critical path. Small prices for a red that always means "look".

The second lane's scenarios are Gherkin (`cucumber`), the same idiom as
kolu's own e2e: "Given a shell running a loopback server, When I snapshot
its subtree, Then the listener is attributed to that shell" is a sentence
worth keeping readable.

## Status

OSF1, OSF2, OSF3, OSF6, and OSF7 are in: the binary's process, listener,
RSS, start-time, cumulative CPU-time, uid, cwd, status, full argv, and complete
host-telemetry facts on both platforms, plus kolu's port sensor. The TypeScript
client exposes exact-pid, subtree, and true host-wide process snapshots. Kolu's
adoption of the *new* facets — memory sampling over osfacts, pid+start identity
gates, and start-qualified daemon ownership — is **not** here; it is phase OSF8,
which has to be designed around the window where old and new daemons coexist
during an upgrade. The contract is
versioned TSV + `--json`, with mandatory `unreadable` and source-error rows,
and kolu spawns the baked store path
(`KOLU_OSFACTS_BIN`). The TypeScript client lives at `client-ts/` as the
package `osfacts-client` (no `@kolu` scope, zero npm runtime deps) — kolu/padi
is the first consumer; drishti is next. The former `@kolu/port-scan` package
is gone: raw protocol in this client, kolu policy in padi, `PortInfo` fold in
`@kolu/terminal-vocab`. Socket-holder lookup and further consumer migrations
are later phases. osfacts
incubates in the kolu monorepo (this directory is the whole future repo) and
moves out when a second external consumer pins it (drishti). Every claim and
number above has its measurement in the plan of record:
[os-facts-tool](https://kolu.dev/atlas/os-facts-tool.html).
