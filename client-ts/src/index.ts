/**
 * osfacts-client — the TypeScript face of the osfacts binary.
 *
 * Zero kolu imports. Zero npm runtime dependencies. The binary's contract
 * only: spawn at a path you supply, refuse a schema version you do not speak,
 * parse typed process, listener, unreadable, and source-error rows, and name
 * the facets a given ask can be answered with. Classification and blindness
 * policy are the consumer's (kolu/padi today; drishti next).
 *
 * The exception, and it is a deliberate one: where a verb's reading has ONE
 * honest domain answer that every consumer would otherwise hand-write the same
 * way, the fold ships here beside the parser — `processIdentity*` over the
 * start-time reading, `osfactsSocketHolders` / `foldSocketOccupancy` over
 * the holder reading. Both keep an "absent" arm that must never collapse into
 * the others, which is exactly the mistake a per-consumer copy makes.
 *
 * The spawn functions are named `<verb><Scope>`, after the binary's own verbs.
 * `snapshotSubtree`, `snapshotPids`, and `snapshotHost` are the three scopes of
 * the `snapshot` verb — processes and sockets — and differ only in which pids
 * they ask about; `snapshotHost` is therefore "every process on this host", not
 * "how the host is doing". `socketHolders` is the `socket-holders` verb, whose
 * scope is a socket PATH rather than a pid set. `host` is the scopeless `host`
 * verb: machine telemetry, no pids at all. They return different types
 * (`SnapshotReading` vs `SocketHoldersReading` vs `HostReading`), so reaching
 * for the wrong one is a type error rather than an empty array.
