//! Pure decoders for the two shapes a unix socket's name arrives in — no OS,

//! here, pinned by unit tests on every platform rather than only the one that
//! can read the source.

///   `/tmp/my state/pty-host.sock` at the space, and a `trim()` corrupts a
///   path that legitimately ends in one.
/// - **A row with no eighth field is skipped** — a connected peer with no
///   bound name, and the header line, both land here.
/// - **Exact bytes, no canonicalization.** The kernel bound the bytes the
///   daemon passed to `bind(2)`; resolving symlinks or normalizing `..` would
///   answer about a different socket than the caller asked about.
/// - **Inode 0 is not a socket identity** — it is what the table prints for a
///   row whose inode it will not disclose, and attributing fds to it would
///   claim every such row at once.
/// - **BYTES, not text.** The table is host-wide, and a socket path is whatever
///   bytes some process handed `bind(2)` — any unprivileged process on the box
///   can bind a name that is not valid UTF-8. Decoding the whole file as a
///   `String` therefore lets one such process fail the read outright and blind
///   this verb for *every* path on the host. A row this parser cannot make
///   sense of costs that row alone.
/// - **One delimiter before the path, not a run.** The byte after the inode
///   column ends the column; every byte after THAT is the name. Skipping a
///   whitespace *run* there eats the leading space of a path that begins with
///   one, and a socket whose name starts with a space then reads as unheld —
